There is a recipe written in DNA

Protein synthesis occurs everywhere in the cell except from nucleus, however the data is inside the nucleus (DNA). RNA moves around and transfers information.

Pores are holes in the nucleus. They are too small for DNa to pass through, but RNA can pass through

RNA goes to fetch the recipe inside the nucleus

RNA is the tool from which the right amino acid will be brought to the protein under construction
