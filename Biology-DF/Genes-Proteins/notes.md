There is a recipe written in DNA

Protein synthesis occurs everywhere in the cell except from nucleus, however the data is inside the nucleus (DNA). RNA moves around and transfers information.

Pores are holes in the nucleus. They are too small for DNa to pass through, but RNA can pass through

RNA goes to fetch the recipe inside the nucleus

RNA is the tool from which the right amino acid will be brought to the protein under construction

Transcrption: read DNA and copy to RNA
translation: assemble amino acids in right order using RNA (using genetic code, 64 options)
It needs 3 nucleotides that are read 3x3, they are called "codons" or "triplets".

It is imperative the sequence is read correctly, (hence STOP thingies), because a misshaped protein is a nonfuncitonal 

To copy RNA:
- Helicase unzips
- Topoisomerase stabilises protein

Not everything is copied, only one gene

RNA Polymerase connects a U in front of an A, for example, etc

Strand that is copied is called template. The template is called the leading strand, which is MISLEADING.
