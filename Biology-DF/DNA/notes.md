having opposing As and Ts for example is called complementarity

# DNA Replication - the enzymatic process

A prior necessity to Mitosis.

Before dividing, the cell must make identical copies of its DNA, it does this during the S phase.

DNA replication is semi-conservative.
```
| |             |  ||    |  ||
| | duplication |  ||    |  ||
| |   ------>   |  ||  + |  ||
| |             |  ||    |  ||
| |             |  ||    |  ||

| = original
|| = copy
```

To duplicate, the DNA "unzips" (original double helix splits, and a new parallel strand is built), enzymes do this in "replication eyes".

For each eye, there are two enzymes (helicases) each working on one side.

- Helicase separates the hydrogen bonds in the DNA.
- DNA polymerase brings the (new) complementary nucleotide in front of the old strand.

INACCURATE MODEL:
```
        /------------------\
-------' /---replication--\ '-------
-------, \-------eye------/ ,-------
        \------------------/
        /|\               /|\
         |                 |
    helicase 1           helicase 2
    works here           works here
```

Two helicase enzymes work on the two antiparallel strands and work in opposite directions. These entymes open the strands from the origin of replication,

As the DNa is being untwisted by the helicases, the topoisomerase corrects any "overwinding" ahead of the replication forks by breaking, swiveling and rejoining DNA strands.



## Meselson and Stahl experiment

Bacteria are put in two (conical) flask. One contains N15 (density 1.8), the other N14 (density 1.65).

These first two tubes are the control experiment.
