# Share your revision sheets and notes
This github repo was made to share your revision sheets. 

# Contribute
- Check [the rules](#Rules)
- make changes or add your file
- create pull request

# Rules
- Preferably have your file in markdown format
- If a revision sheet not too different from yours exists, consider contributing to the existing one rather than making your own.
- Of course place everything in the right folder
   - Folders work like this: `Subject/Chapter/document.md`
- Commit messages don't have to be very detailed, but still make it clear what you did.
