### What made fascism so attractive?
The economic factor
- Fascism aims to take control of the economy, skipping any "natural stabilisation" process that may occur from a free economy. And going straight to state-set priorities.
- Control of the economy could promise security, in terms of food, commodities, etc
- This could allow to create job opportunities, at least in the short term.
Autarchy: Create everything inside the country: everything local, self-sustained. For example, during the great depression, Italy wasn't as affected.

### The iron grip of fascism

- Propaganda
